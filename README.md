1. What is the nature of the gameplay? That is, what challenges will the player face? What actions will the player take to overcome those challenges?

The nature of the gameplay involves the player having to throw as many weapons (swords) as possible onto a rotating circular robot The challenge for the player is to get the perfect timing to shoot the sword so that it lands on an empty space on the board and not on an already occupied space. For each level, the player has to place a specific number of swords on the board to clear it. Every time a player places all the swords on the rotating circle, the swords are cleared and a new level starts with increasing difficulty, such as obstacles on the robot that the sword should not land on, increasing speed of the rotating robot, and more.


 2. What is the victory condition for the game? What is the player trying to achieve?

The player tries to achieve the following conditions: 
Getting the highest score possible (either easy or hard mode)
Score is the number of knives cleared per level.

 3. What is the player's interaction model (mouse/keyboard)?

All user interactions will involve only mouse clicking.

 4. What is the general structure of the game? What is going on in each mode, and what function does each mode fulfill?

The game is divided into two difficulty modes:
Easy: Every board that is cleared increases the number of swords by a random amount (between 5 to 11) and the speed will increase (not by a significant amount).
Hard: Similar to easy mode, however, the robot circle changes rotational speed at random times, obstacles come and go, and every 10 levels the user encounters a boss.

The user loses if the newly shot sword hits an existing sword or any other obstacle. In such cases, the game restarts from level 1.

 5. Does the game have a narrative or story as it goes along? If so, summarize the plot. 

The game will have a simple narrative. A.V.A, an acronym for “Angry Virtual Avatar” (named after the first letters of all the names of our group members), is a killer robot that plans to take over the planet of CAP3032. The player is assigned with taking down A.V.A by attempting to stop the robot by impaling it with laser swords. The game goes on infinitely as A.V.A. is a powerful robot that never dies.
6. Why would anyone want to play this game? What sort of people would be attracted to this game?

This game is a great stress relief and is also very addicting. The high score objective gives the player the incentive to beat other player’s high scores. Overall, the game is aimed for those that seek mindless fun and have a competitive spirit within them.
